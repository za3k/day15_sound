Hack-A-Day is a project I'm doing in November, where I try to make 30 new projects, in 30 days.

# Day 15: Hack-A-Sound

This is a sound mixing toy.

Features:

- 25 pre-generated random samples
- Record you own samples with a mic
- Keyboard and mouse support. Mobile probably not supported.
- 4 tracks. Set delay and loop tracks separately
